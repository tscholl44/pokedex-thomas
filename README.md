# Thomas' Pokedex

## Description
Thomas' Pokedex is a web app that uses an external API to retrieve data on pokemon in a pokedex. The pokedex is organized into buttons laid on a Bootstrap grid which expand into a modal of pokemon data and pokemon image when clicked.

## Goals of this project
create a dataset for a pokemon list that can be connected to an API
practice with conditionals and loops to iterate this dataset
create dynamic elements using javascript instead of HTML
practice using ajax and asynchronous behavior
use bootstrap to achieve clean modals, a bootstrap grid and utilize UI libraries

## Challenges
Once I got a handle on the basic functions I wanted to work with to run my pokemon list, the greatest challenge was utilizing those functions in integration with bootstrap. I found it difficult to keep track of what I had created dynamically in js to interact with html elements, and what had been hardwired into the html.

## Lessons from this project
The greatest lesson I learned from this project is that organization and step-by-step mastery is key. This can be achieved by keeping consistently formatted and clear comments for all functions. I also learned a great deal about the interaction between common tools in a web dev techstack and how each is implemented.
